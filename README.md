This is one of the simplest introduction project to IOT Devices. For this project I have created a simple smart lock which can work on doors. 

HOW IT FUNCTIONS
When the user inputs the password it will determine if the password is correct and if correct it will give them aceess into the room and display on the screen 'access granted'  (this is represented by the servo motor which will move 90 degrees)
After 5s after opening it will automatically close to avoid people who don't have access not to come in.
If the user gives a wrong password the beeper will beep to notify you you don't have access and also it will display on the LCD 'access denied'
